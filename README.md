Portfolio site for the Eco Explorer game concept: a lightweight, multiâ€‘language landing with highlights, media, and an optional chatbot section.

## What It Does
- Presents the game pitch, feature highlights, and conservation angle
- Offers multiâ€‘language content (EN, PT, ES, FR)
- Embeds optional chatbot (Hugging Face Space) for Q&A
- Includes simple newsletter form and contact links
- Ships as a static site with basic offline support

## Run Locally

### Local Development Server
```bash
# Navigate to the website directory
cd eco-explorer-website

# Start Python's built-in server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open your browser to: http://localhost:8000
```

Or use VS Codeâ€™s Live Server extension on `index.html`.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements

The website requires a proper HTTP server because:

1. **Service Worker** - Requires HTTPS or localhost for offline functionality
2. **CORS Policy** - External resources need proper headers
3. **Form Handling** - Local JavaScript handlers for newsletter/contact forms
4. **Security** - Modern browsers block features when opening files directly

## Chatbot (Optional)
- Embeds the EcoExplorerBot (Hugging Face Spaces)
- Used for quick Q&A about the project and conservation theme

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Features

- **Jaguar Spots Pattern** - Authentic onÃ§a pintada inspired background
- **Wild Glow Effects** - Animated blue glow elements
- **Glass Morphism** - Modern glass-like effects
- **Gradient Borders** - Blue gradient styling throughout
- **Responsive Navigation** - Mobile-first design
- **Accessibility** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management

## Sections
- Hero, pillars, and feature highlights
- Media embed (YouTube) and screenshots
- Chatbot (optional)
- Newsletter and contact

## Focus
- Educational conservation theme (Itatiaia NP, jaguar)
- Simple, accessible presentation over heavy frameworks

## Tech Stack
- HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Simple i18n (JSON locales)
- Optional service worker

## Status & Learnings
- Functional concept site for the game
- Learnings: contentâ€‘first landing, simple i18n, and static deployments

## License

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Website Not Loading?
- Make sure you're using a proper HTTP server (not just opening the HTML file)
- Check that all files are in the correct directories
- Try refreshing the page

### Forms Not Working?
- Newsletter and Contact forms work locally with JavaScript handlers
- They show success messages without needing a backend
- For production, connect to your preferred form service (Netlify Forms, Formspree, etc.)

### Language Not Switching?
- Check that all locale JSON files are present
- Ensure the language switcher is functioning
- Try refreshing the page after language change

### Service Worker Issues?
- Service worker requires HTTPS in production
- For local development, localhost is fine
- Check browser DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Service Workers

### Port Already in Use?
```bash
# Try a different port
python3 -m http.server 8001
```

## Deploy
- Any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
