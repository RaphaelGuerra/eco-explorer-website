## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Website Not Loading?
- Make sure you're using a proper HTTP server (not just opening the HTML file)
- Check that all files are in the correct directories
- Try refreshing the page

### Forms Not Working?
- Newsletter and Contact forms work locally with JavaScript handlers
- They show success messages without needing a backend
- For production, connect to your preferred form service (Netlify Forms, Formspree, etc.)

### Language Not Switching?
- Check that all locale JSON files are present
- Ensure the language switcher is functioning
- Try refreshing the page after language change

### Service Worker Issues?
- Service worker requires HTTPS in production
- For local development, localhost is fine
- Check browser DevTools → Application → Service Workers

### Port Already in Use?
```bash
# Try a different port
python3 -m http.server 8001
```
